# Rangeslider

⭐️⭐️⭐️ ALPHA ⭐️⭐️⭐️

## Introduction

A component inspired by the behavioural flexibility of [RC Slider](https://github.com/react-component/slider)
but taking advantage of the customisability offered by the Render Props pattern.

The component exposes its state via a child function, leaving the UI completely 
customisable by the consuming app. Go nuts.

## Roadmap

The aim is to reach parity with RC Slider. In order of priority, the 
remaining features are...

1. ACCESSIBILITY!
1. Touch support
1. Allow update via props
1. Steps
1. Lifecycle hooks
1. Toggle enabled state
1. Vertical mode
1. Pushable handles
